            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p>Nandha Educational Institutions provide the students an accommodation that will be always a Home away from Home feel and ambiance while staying at Hostel. We provide a safe, clean and comfortable eco-friendly environment in a lush green campus that supports the development of a vibrant Nandha student community. Overall, students can have a pollution-free breath.

    <h2>DETAILS</h2>
    <p>
        The Nandha Engineering is alive to the expectations of its students who come here from a wide variety of cultural and geographical zones. It offers them excellent living accommodation within the campus, separately for boys and girls. As most of the students in hostels leave their homes for the first time in their lives, the college is very concerned about making this transition smooth and comfortable.
    </p>

        Living in student accommodation can be an exciting and rewarding experience.

There will also be opportunities for personal growth and development as the students start adjusting to a new way of living and experience cultural diversity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the challenges encountered by the students while living at our hostel help them learn to live with roommates from different backgrounds, handle neighbors of different thinking, and deal with situations they have never encountered before.

        We have a team of friendly and helpful Resident Wardens, Resident Advisors, Resident Assistants, and Common Room Canteen Committee members to offer the support and assistance you may need in making this transition a positive one. Our institutionâ€™s Principals take additional responsibility as Chief Warden, making the hostel stay disciplined and secure in every way.
